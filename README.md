# Estimating_B117
Accompanying code to "Estimating B117 variant emergence in a university setting"

UT_B117_main.Rmd loads in all of the data (Ct values from testing lab, student case data by test type, and fall introduction estimates). 
It processes the data and uses it as inputs to call the functions that do the fitting of the B117 prevalence and that run the SEIR models
to estimate the current and future infections on campus, and generate figures from these function outputs.
